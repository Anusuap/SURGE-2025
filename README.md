**ðŸ“˜ Project Context**
This project was carried out as a part of the SURGE 2025 research internship program at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). It represents the culmination of my summer research efforts undertaken during the internship period.

The work was conducted under the supervision and mentorship of Professor Suprio Bhar, whose guidance played a pivotal role in shaping the direction and depth of this project. The study lies at the intersection of probability theory and stochastic processes, and involved a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations.

The repository includes all LaTeX source files used to compile the final report, along with relevant code snippets, mathematical formulations, and visualizations.
